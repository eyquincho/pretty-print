# Pretty Print

## Overview
---

Sometimes it's handy to just have all your cards and their descriptions in one list. Maybe you want to print out your cards or export them to PDF.

With this power-up, you can choose which lists you want. The list, all its cards, their labels, and their descriptions will appear, fully formatted, ready to print or save.

## How to Use

Try these tips to get the most out of this power-up.

### Tip #1:

You can use this power-up to export your board into a nicely formatted PDF document. Instead of choosing a printer, select "Save as PDF" in your print settings:

### Tip #2: 

Make sure to check your printer settings if you aren't happy with how your page looks.

I usually go with the following:

- Top and Bottom Margins: 0.25in
- Left and Right Margins: 0

### Tip #3:

If you have a lot of empty page space happening on your print preview, here are some things you can try to get it the way you like:

- Check or uncheck the box that says "Start each list on a new page." It's enabled by default, which makes sure you don't have a list title showing up at the end of a page. You can disable it if you don't want this option.
- Try printing out just 2-3 lists at a time. Sometimes this can help in grouping the lists more appropriately.

### Tip #4:

You can disable the card colors to save printer ink! Just check the box that says "Card backgrounds" and that formatting will disappear.

If you do want the colors to show up in print; however, make sure you double check your printer settings and turn on background graphics:
