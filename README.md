# Tips:

## Tip #1:

You can use this power-up to export your board into a nicely formatted PDF document. Instead of choosing a printer, select "Save as PDF" in your print settings:

[![save as pdf](https://cdn.glitch.global/2a75c8f8-e3cd-4a74-9533-882132c11066/save-pdf.png?v=1657900169598)](https://cdn.glitch.global/2a75c8f8-e3cd-4a74-9533-882132c11066/save-pdf.png?v=1657900169598)

## Tip #2: 

The default margins are set to: 

- **Paper Size:** A4
- **Top and Bottom Margins:** 0.25in
- **Left and Right Margins:** 0

If you wish to change this, you can do so in the print settings (in Chrome, check the "More Settings" option):

## Tip #3:

If you have a lot of empty page space happening on your print preview, here are some things you can try to get it the way you like:

- Check or uncheck the box that says "Start each list on a new page." It's enabled by default, which makes sure you don't have a list title showing up at the end of a page. You can disable it if you don't want this option.
- Try printing out just 2-3 lists at a time. Sometimes this can help in grouping the lists more appropriately.

## Tip #4:

You can disable the card colors to save printer ink! Just check the box that says "Card backgrounds" and that formatting will disappear.

If you do want the colors to show up in print; however, make sure you double check your printer settings and turn on background graphics:
