> Sometimes it's handy to just have all your cards and their descriptions in one list. Maybe you want to print out your cards or export them to PDF.
> 
> With this Power-Up, you can choose which lists you want. The list, all its cards, their labels, and their descriptions will appear, fully formatted, ready to print or save.

## 💡 Tips

 You can use this Power-Up to export your board into a nicely formatted PDF document. Instead of choosing a printer, select *"Save as PDF"* in your print settings:

📄 The default margins are set to: 

>💠 **Paper Size:** A4
>
>💠 **Top and Bottom Margins:** 0.25in
>
>💠 **Left and Right Margins:** 0

If you wish to change this, you can do so in the print settings (in Chrome, check the *"More Settings"* option):

If you don't like the amount of white space in your print preview, here are some things you can try:
    
>💠 Check or uncheck the box that says *"Start each list on a new page."*
>
>💠 Try printing out just 2-3 lists at a time. Sometimes this can help in grouping the lists more appropriately.

You can also disable the card colors to save printer ink! Just check the box that says *"Show card backgrounds"* and that formatting will disappear.

If you do want the colors to show up in print; however, make sure you double check your print settings and *turn on background graphics*:
